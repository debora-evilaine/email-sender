# Welcome to Email Sender! 📩📨

---
This repo contains the code for the Email Sender, a HTML page in which the user can input their name and email and receive a personalized email afterwards.

The backend of the application is written in Java with Spring Boot, due to its powerful web application tools, and the email sending is handled by Mailtrap. Code reuse, scalability and stability are vital in the construction of this project, which is why the code is always written as cleanly and simply as possible.

### Credits 📽️

This project would not exist if it weren't for [Amigoscode's Spring Boot video](https://youtu.be/9SGDpanrc8U?si=3rVnZbBKxWhaZiop), which kickstarted my knowledge on Spring Boot
and gave me the necessary tools to begin this project; I highly recommend you check him out!
